# AI-CyberThreatIntel_NLP

In this example, the script uses the requests library to retrieve text data from a web page containing threat intelligence. The spacy library is then used to extract named entities from the text, which can provide information about potential threat actors, targets, and malware.

The extract_entities function uses NLP to identify named entities in the text and their associated labels, such as PERSON for individual names or ORG for organizations. The process_threat_intelligence function combines the get_text and extract_entities functions to retrieve and analyze threat intelligence from a specified URL.

This is a simple example of how NLP can be used for AI CTI. More sophisticated models can be trained on larger datasets of threat intelligence to identify patterns and trends, and to generate alerts and recommendations for threat response.
